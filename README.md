## Assignment: Collaborative Filters for Learning

In this unit you will be building a collaborative filter. Collaborative filters are a class of algorithm used to suggest content to a given user (filtering) by leveraging information about many users (collaboration). There are many flavors of collaborative filter and they are very commonly used in scenarios where there is incomplete information about a user's preferences such as Netflix suggestions or product recommendations on Amazon.
